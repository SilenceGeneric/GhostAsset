To **identify**, **catalog**, and **aid in the takedown** of high-priority fugitives — one photo, one lead, one bounty at a time. GhostAsset was built to be the perfect ally for federal agencies, created by someone who doesn’t wait for permission to do the right thing.

## 🚀 Terminal Launch Script

For Linux/macOS users, you can use the included `ghostasset.sh` to run the tool:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# GhostAsset Launcher Script

echo "====================================="
echo "   👤 Launching GhostAsset v1.0"
echo "====================================="

# Set the script directory
DIR="$(cd "$(dirname "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}")" && pwd)"

# Check Python3
if ! command -v python3 &> /dev/null
then
    echo "❌ Python3 is not installed. Install it and try again."
    exit 1
fi

# Check if Pillow is installed
if ! python3 -c "from PIL import Image" &> /dev/null
then
    echo "📦 Pillow not found. Installing it now..."
    pip3 install --user pillow
fi

# Launch the Python GUI
echo "🚀 Starting GhostAsset..."
python3 "$DIR/ghostasset.py"
```

To use:

## ⚠️ Legal Note

GhostAsset is a private intelligence tool. All tips or suspicions must be reported through **official FBI channels**.  
Never engage suspects directly. You are not law enforcement — you're the quiet hand that feeds them leads.

Use this tool **responsibly**, **ethically**, and always within the bounds of the law.

---

## 💼 Why GhostAsset Exists

You’re not just trying to help — you’re building a **reputation**. The kind of reputation that turns heads in federal buildings.  
The kind that gets things done.

> **GhostAsset is more than software.**  
> It's a digital footprint of every move you make toward justice — and every dollar you earn doing it.
